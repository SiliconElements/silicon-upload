# Install

`bower install m4b/silicon-upload`

# Usage

Simple widget to upload a binary file to a server given in `url`.  Use auto upload as soon as the file is picked, or drag and dropped in.

Example:

````html
<silicon-upload url="http://example.com/upload" auto></silicon-upload>
````

You can specify the width and height of the dropbox, and manually generate an upload by calling `upload()`.
